# Automation

Status: implemented

- GitHub Actions checks every push and pull request.
- Vite+ (`vp`) is the project command entry point. The pinned pnpm version and
  `pnpm-lock.yaml` remain authoritative underneath it, and CI installs the
  lockfile frozen.
- Only native dependencies allowlisted in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` may run install scripts.
- The scheduled refresh runs hourly with jitter and commits the validated
  catalog, public-only parsed pricing compiler input, canonical pricing,
  derived UI/export asset indexes and packs, fetch state, quarantine, and
  refresh summary using a `chore(data): ...` commit.
- The workflow schedules, validates, and commits a collection run; it does not
  interpret provider failures. The collector owns failure classification and
  the safe public status projection. A workflow failure before collection
  commits nothing and is reported only by GitHub Actions.
- The catalog and canonical pricing advance as one validated accepted pair. Collection
  creates both consumer projections, stages immutable pair snapshots, advances
  one atomic pointer, and repairs durable mirrors after interruption. Production
  verifies the pair-bound projection manifests and encoded entry hashes without
  parsing the canonical pair.
- The `compile:pricing` task also makes canonical pricing compilation available
  independently. It performs no fetch, validates the catalog-bound public
  parsed input, and republishes the accepted pair and projections. The
  `prepare:assets` task remains the narrower projection-only repair.
- `KMODELS_PRICING_RELEASE_INPUT` is an optional reviewed manual-release input
  for explicit absence/removal/withdrawal intents and pair-bound safety
  findings. Scheduled source adapters cannot create it; an unresolved finding
  must be resupplied for every attempted build until a safe pair commits.
- Provider secrets are optional. Missing secrets skip only their scoped inventories.
- Deployment uses the pinned `void` dependency and GitHub OIDC. `void.json` deploys static `dist/`; `VOID_PROJECT` is the only repository variable.
- Renovate uses the Shanghai timezone, a seven-day minimum release age, grouped automerge for non-major updates, and isolated manual major updates.
